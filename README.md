# CSV Data Visualization with PapaParse and Google Charts


This project demonstrates how to load and visualize CSV data using PapaParse for parsing and Google Charts for visualization. The program fetches CSV data, processes it, and displays various charts based on user interaction.





## Features

**Fetch and Parse CSV Data**: Uses PapaParse to download and parse a CSV file located in the same directory.

**Process Data**: Converts the data into numeric format where applicable.

**Visualize Data**: Uses Google Charts to create and display charts based on the parsed data.

**User Interaction**: Provides buttons to view different types of charts (views, likes, subscriptions, and viewing time).



- **Simple Interface**: The interface is easy to use, focusing on functionality without unnecessary complexity.
